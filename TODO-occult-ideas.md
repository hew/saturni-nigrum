# Occult Scene Ideas - TODO

## Hidden Octahedron in Cube
**Status**: Partially implemented, needs refinement

### Concept
- Inside the black cube is its dual polyhedron - an octahedron
- Represents the spiritual fire hidden within matter
- Only visible at certain rotation angles
- The diamond (octahedron) within the lead (cube)

### Implementation Notes
- Octahedron geometry is created as wireframe
- Visibility controlled by rotation angles and time
- Counter-rotates to the cube for dynamic effect
- Color shifts from deep purple to brighter when more visible

### Challenges
- Making the octahedron visible requires either:
  - Transparent cube (looks weird, breaks minimalist aesthetic)
  - Special rendering techniques
  - Only showing tips that protrude from cube

### Possible Solutions
1. Use stencil buffer to create "x-ray" view at certain angles
2. Shader that makes cube selectively transparent
3. Project octahedron shadow onto ground
4. Show octahedron only during specific "ritual" moments
5. Use it as a transformation effect rather than persistent element

### Symbolic Meaning
- Cube = material world, matter, earth element
- Octahedron = spiritual world, air/fire element  
- Together they form the complete reality
- "As above, so below" - the dual nature of existence

## Other Ideas for Future Implementation

### Vibrational Encoding
- Cube pulses at 432Hz (sacred frequency)
- Edge brightness encodes Fibonacci sequence
- Rotation speed = Earth's precession scaled

### Temporal Gatekeeping
- Certain features only visible at specific times
- Use astronomical calculations (Saturn's position, moon phase)
- The initiated know when to visit

### Shadow Mysteries
- Cube's shadow forms different shapes at different angles
- At noon (specific rotation) shadow is circular (squaring the circle)
- Shadow could reveal hidden symbols

### Mathematical Breadcrumbs
- Coordinates display not in X,Y but in sacred ratios
- Distance from center = multiples of 3, 5, 7
- Viewing angle encodes degrees of initiation
