### My New Website is Now My Only Application Form

Let's be honest, the hiring process for developers is broken.

Portfolios are boring. Résumés are lists of exaggerations. LinkedIn is a cesspool. I'm tired of talking to recruiters who don't know the difference between Java and JavaScript, and I'm tired of "opportunities" from clients who want a Facebook clone for $500.

So, I've fixed it. My new personal website is now my *only* filter.

You see that black cube spinning on my homepage? It looks simple, doesn't it? It's not. Think of it as an interview. A test. A digital escape room. If you want to work with me, you have to solve it.

There is no `/contact` page. My email address isn't hiding in the source code (nice try, though). The only way to get in touch with me is to unlock the secrets hidden within the site itself.

"But what does a spinning cube have to do with your skills as a developer?"

Everything.

It shows that I care about the details. That I can build a complex, stateful application with vanilla Three.js and Svelte. That I understand user interaction, animation, and creating an experience that goes deeper than just fetching and displaying data. It shows I can build something that's performant, responsive, and, dare I say, interesting.

If you're a potential client, this is the level of quality and creativity you'd be hiring. If you can't be bothered to engage with it, we're not a good fit. If you get frustrated and leave, you've failed the interview.

I'm looking for clients who are curious. Who have an eye for detail. Who aren't afraid of a challenge. Everyone else can go hire a "WordPress expert" off Fiverr.

So, is this the most arrogant way to find work? Or is it the smartest?

Go ahead. Prove you're one of the smart ones. I'll wait.

But not for long.
