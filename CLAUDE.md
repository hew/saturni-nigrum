### Important Notes

‚ùå Don't just start coding "simpler" versions of what I ask for if you hit a block. Just return and ask for help.

‚ùå Do NOT make assumptions. Just ask me for clarification if needed.

‚úÖ ALWAYS work in a TDD style.
‚úÖ Always start with a test FIRST, and then the implementation.
